EIZO FlexScan SX3031W
=====================

My EIZO FlexScan SX3031W reached its end-of-life so I disassembled it to see what was inside it.

Monitor
-------

_Some very large PCBs_

<sub>The one second from the right is just for supporting the backlighting tubes.</sub>

_An almost obscene amount of really substantial pieces of metal._

_More metal._

_The LCD panel (from Samsung) with various diffusers for the backlighting._

_Even more diffusers and the back-panel for the backlighting tubes and the tubes themselves._

_Various plastic inserts and separators._

_Various connectors, fans, the buttons (for on/off etc.) and an amazing number of screws and bolts._

Stand
-----

The monitor is extremely heavy so the stand has to be correspondingly heavy to prevent it tipping over.

_More substantial pieces of metal._

<sub>The left-most plate is amazingly heavy.</sub>

_Various pieces (some of which I didn't completely disassemble) and more screws and bolts._
